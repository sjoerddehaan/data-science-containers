    "### What is a data science envrionment?\n",
    "\n",
    "With data science envrionment, I mean the collections of software that a data scientist uses to develop a product, or to perform an analysis. A common setup includes at least three types of software packages:\n",
    "- A programming language (Python and R are very popular)\n",
    "- A IDE that allows for interactive programming (For example Jupyter notebooks, and R- studio)\n",
    "- A collection of libraries that is used for the analysis (The Pandas packages for Python, and dplyr for R)\n",
    "\n",
    "On top off that, you may have other software applications\n",
    "- Databases (MongoDB, MariaDB)\n",
    "- Deep learning (Theano, TensorFlow, Keras)\n",
    "- Distributed systems (Hadoop, Spark)\n",
    "- Backend for website, app or API (node, flask)\n",
    "- Frontend (angularjs, d3)\n",
    "- Streaming frameworks (Kafka)\n",
    "- Cloud solutions (Amazon, Azure, Google)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The reproducibility problem\n",
    "Suppose I want to work with you on my project. Installing all these packages on your laptop is tedious. Moreover, it is very likely that you cannot exeactly reproduce the setup that I was using. You may have a different operating system, or different versions of your software. It gets even more complicated when different several software applications are configured to work together, as this typically requires manual work.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Containers - a solution to the reproducibility problem\n",
    "A container, is an isolated part of your computer, that encapsulates an application together with all it's dependencies. Programming languages, packages, your code, and even the operating system of our application can be packaged in a container. If you want to work on my project, I send you the project container, which you can start using immedeatly."
